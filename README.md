hello, i'm a Latino in tech and a senior frontend engineer working in higher education at [UC Merced](http://ucmerced.edu).

previously, i was a [Stack Overflow engineer](https://meta.stackexchange.com/users/259198/allejo) known for my efforts of refactoring the frontend into [Webpack modules](https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/383086), developing [Winter Bash 2022](https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/384751), and sunsetting Developer Stories + Stack Overflow Jobs v1. [i was laid off](https://allejo.io/blog/being-promoted-to-customer-at-stack-overflow/) due to financial mismanagement and poor company leadership.

over the years, i have been involved in a lot of open source efforts,
