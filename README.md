hello, I'm a senior frontend engineer currently working in Higher Ed at [UC Merced](http://ucmerced.edu)

previously, i was a [Stack Overflow engineer](https://meta.stackexchange.com/users/259198/allejo) leading accessibility and frontend refactoring efforts, both of which were not a financial priority for the company since my efforts died with my being laid off

i try to maintain a number of open sources but my time is limited nowadays,
